            <h2>Getting Started.</h2>
            <p>
              Digital devices and services are an integral part of 
              our lives. It’s hard to imagine a life without smartphones,
              search engines, apps, and having a huge selection of music
               and movies at our fingertips. All of these things make our lives
              so much easier. However, you may be surprised to discover that
              the data that you’re sending and receiving all over the globe
              actually carries rather heavy baggage: an individual’s online
              activities are responsible for producing 414 kgs of carbon dioxide
              every year.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Carbonet.in</strong> seeks to raise awareness
              about the environmental impacts of using digital devices
              and the internet.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>How it works:</strong> Visit the
                <a href="#calculator">"Calculator"</a> section on our page and answer a few questions.
                 We perform a few calculations based on data gathered from resources to estimate your
                 carbon footprint from digital device usage. You are always invited to 
                contribute!

            <p>
              This page was created to serve as a platform for people
              to access our calculator, and to accumulate all resources
              for people who might be interested in knowing more.

            <h2>The Environmental Impact of Going Online</h2>
            <p>
              Each search query emits around 1.45 grams of CO2. If we
             use a search engine to make around 50 search queries per
             day, this produces a huge 26 kilograms of CO2 per year. This
             may not sound like a lot at the individual level but a single
             search query billions of times around the globe adds up to
            leave an environmental impact that is difficult to ignore.
             Streaming a one hour show on Netflix consumes about 300 watt hours
            of electric energy. This is equivalent to driving one kilometre
             in a small car. Collectively, the average CO2 consumption of
            streamed online video is more than 300 million tons per year. 
            This is the same as emitted by the whole of Spain in a year.

            </p>
            <p>Our use of digital technologies contributes to 3.7% of
               global CO2 emissions, which has a bigger impact on global warming
                than the entire aviation industry.
            </p>
           
            <p>
             An improved understanding of impacts is necessary to make solutions
              for accessible and solutions more unambiguous.

            <h2>Your Carbon Footprint Calculator</h2>
            <p>
              We use a very simple algorithm and average data collected from research papers,
              websites, and books to estimate your footprint.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should know that this estimation is very rough since a lot of factors cannot be accounted for. 
              More on this later!
