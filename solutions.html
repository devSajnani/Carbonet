        <p class="title">We can work together on some solutions to reduce your Digital Carbon Footprint.</p>
        <div class="solution">
    <div id="ecosia">
        <p>Switching to greener search engines like Ecosia can greatly help the environment. Ecosia says it will plant a tree for every 45 searches it performs. This sort of carbon offsetting can help remove carbon from the atmosphere. Also minimizing the number of tabs you have open at any one time, and making use of bookmarks rather than Google searches to find frequently visited websites can keep your footprint down.</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="Streaming">
        <p>Some viewers use YouTube and song streaming services as background noise, and sometimes even fall asleep, generating carbon for no gain. Cutting back on these uses or stopping videos from playing unintentionally on an open browser when you are not watching, could help keep your carbon footprint down.</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="music">
        <p>Streaming music and videos greatly add to your digital carbon footprint. Opting to download rather than streaming means youâ€™ll pull the data from the server only once,making it a more eco-friendly alternative.</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="sms">
        <p>Choosing to send an SMS text message is the perhaps the most environmentally-friendly alternative as a way of staying in touch because each text generates just 0.014g of CO2.</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="emails">
        <p>By simply minimising the unnecessary emails we send, especially to multiple recipients we could collectively save a lot of carbon emissions. Swapping email attachments for links to documents is another easy way to reduce our digital carbon footprints, as well as unsubscribing from mailing lists we no longer read. According to estimates by antispam service Cleanfox, the average user receives 2,850 unwanted emails every year from subscriptions, which are responsible for 28.5kg CO2.</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="upgrade">
        <p>As an individual, simply upgrading our equipment less often is one way of cutting the carbon footprint of our digital technology, whose manufacturing and transportation emits a significant amount of greenhouse gases. One study at the University of Edinburgh found that extending the time you use a single computer/monitor from four to six years could avoid the equivalent of 190kg of carbon emissions.</p>

        <h2 >Non-Technical Solutions</h2>
        <p>Just because we're focusing on the internet does not mean there cannot be more solutions outside the domain of technology.<br>
            Find in this section some ways to reduce your footprint that aren't exactly intuitive.

        <div class="solution">
        <div >
            <p>Consider investing in a solar power bank. Although they are a bit costlier than your normal power banks, the impact they can have on saving the environment isn't something to laugh at.
                Not only do they essentially charge your device at the same rate, or even faster in some cases, they consume no electricity. If everyone around the world gets a solar powerbank, electric power consumption can reduce by around 100$ per year per person.

            <p>Although most of us adore pets, it can't be denied that they have a huge carbon footprint. If a hypothetical country of only pets existed, it would be 5th in the world in terms of carbon emissions. 
                This moves us to really simple ways in which you can reduce the footprint your pet has. The very first solution is to change your treats. With many companies now launching eco-friendly pet treats, even though it would sound a bit weird when you tell your friends that you feed your dog eco-friendly food, they essentially reduce emissions by 10%. It's even better if those treats are locally produced since there isn't a large transport emission.<br>
                Another solution could be to not always go to walk in a park. What I am trying to say is you don't necessarily need to drive your car to the nearest park, take a round, and then come back home. Instead, just walk your dog on the streets. 
                This seems kind of obvious, but it's absolutely
